# IMDB-project

I am currently working on this project. Until now, I have created a navigation bar and several pages for
my site: a movie page which contains a list of my favourite movies,
a TV shows page which contains a
list of my favourite TV shows, a main page, a Register/Log in page and an About me page. For the
main page I have created a gallery of pictures by using Ja vaScript. For the routing process I have
used Node.js (Express). For the Register/Log in process I have used MongoDB in order to store the
email and the password of users.
Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node (Express)
